# Polynomial-Equation-Solver
Object-Oriented implementation of polynomial operations in Python including arithmetic, derivatives, and quadratic root solving.
# POLYNOMIAL OPERTION USING OOP IN PYTHON
## Overview
This project implements a Polynomial Equation Solver using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in Python.

The `Polynomial` class models mathematical polynomials and supports arithmetic operations, evaluation, differentiation, and quadratic root finding.
## Features
- Polynomial representation using coefficient list
- String formatting in mathematical form
- Polynomial evaluation at any value of x
- Operator overloading:
  - Addition (`+`)
  - Subtraction (`-`)
  - Multiplication (`*`)
- Derivative computation
- Quadratic root solving (real and complex roots)
- Full input validation and exception handling
